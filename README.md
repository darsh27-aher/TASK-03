* **Used Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (binary classification: malignant vs. benign).
* **Preprocessing**: Split data into train/test sets and scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
* **Model**: Trained a Logistic Regression model using `sklearn`.
* **Evaluation**: Used confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to assess performance.
* **Visualization**: Plotted ROC Curve to show model accuracy.
* **Sigmoid Function**: Explained how it converts model output to probabilities between 0 and 1.
